In this lab we had to create a Toaster with bake, toast, and broil functions using out PICKIT3 boards. We had to implement a lot of the coding and testing that we learnt of the PICKIT3 from lab6.

To start off the lab, I first had to understand which functions to add into the updateOvenOLED() function, and since the toaster had 3 different functions with different temperature settings, I first started off with writing pseudocode for each of the differences. Once I coded these functions I then had to test it on the PickIt which was quite confusing to me, but the pdf instructions were very helpful. Then we had to create timers so that we could time how long the "oven" was in use. I had a lot of issues with overflow errors, and it was also difficult to keep track of all the differences between the 3 functions of the oven, but through a lot of debugging and testing I was able to get my code to finally compile.

This lab was very hard to complete, since it was only our second time using the PickIt, and it was also a lot harder since the TA's werent as available to ask specific questions. Although I had many setbacks and errors along the way, through really reading every line of the pdf, and doing external research about the PickIt on youtube, I was able to solve almost all of my confusion. It was also very new to set timers and see the direct effects of the different functions when called on the board.
