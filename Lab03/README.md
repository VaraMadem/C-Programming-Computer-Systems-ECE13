In this lab we learnt how to write functions that print and operate on matrices, and are able to run tests to see if the calculations are correct. I feel like the most important aspects of the lab was testing to see if your functions matched the calculated values, and through loops iterating through the matix to perform calculations.

My approach to this lab was first creating all teh functions that performed the calculations through my understanding of matrices and looping through the iterations, and then using the MatrixEquals function to thoroughly test each operation. If I were to do this lab again, I might create tests as I write the functions, instead of doing them all at once. 

I spent a little over 2 days completing this lab. I thought it was quite difficult to first have to understand how the matrix operations work before being able to code the functions, since some functions, especially the inverse function is quite hard to understand on its own. I think it would be beneficial if the inverse function was removed from this lab, considering many are not efficient in it normally speaking- let alone in code form.
