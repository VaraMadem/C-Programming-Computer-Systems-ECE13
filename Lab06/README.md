In this lab we learnt how to use our PICkit3 with C prgramming to code for the buttons switches and display on the board. The goal of the lab was to set timers that went of at different intervals that lit up the board.

For this lab I first had to learn how to understand how what parts of the board we were coding for, and what the expected output really was. I spent a lot of time reading through the files and playing with the boards and attempting to write pseudocode to help assist me. I first started off with the buttons_timers file and followed the order in our lab intstructions and then tested each file seperately for any erros an to debug.

This lab took me a very long time to understand, but I came out learning completely new information. I've never really worked with any hardware prior to this class and lab so this was a challenging but new experience. Although the lab files were extrememly helpful and necessary to guiding us in this lab, I wished there were a lot more explanations to help guide us through the already given codes and templates. I also have a Mac so the process was a bit different and I wish we had been given more information about testing the board and just in general about the connections.
