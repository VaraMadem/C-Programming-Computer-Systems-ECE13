- What happens if the line “scanf(" ");” executes?  Why?
Nothing will happen since there is no input value given, and nothing is there to scan.

- In this lab, we forbid you from using printf() or scanf() inside of certain functions.  Explain why a rule like this is useful.
This rule is useful because these functions are only really used when reading user input and outputing values for the user to read. Both of these functions are not needed in the background calculator functions that the user does not take part in.


- How long did this lab take you?  Was it harder or easier than you expected? What challenges did you encounter?
This lab took me a couple days from start to finish, at first it seemed really easy, but as bugs started to appear it took a bit longer than expected. But overall the lab was not too complicated and I could instead use my time to play around with the print and scan functions.
