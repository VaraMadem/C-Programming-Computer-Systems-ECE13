SelectionSort Time: 39.424ms InsertionSort Time: 36.134ms

InsertionSort is faster because it only traverses through the necessary elements while SelectionSort traverses through the entire list every time in order to place an element.
In this lab we were learnt how to create LinkedLists and create sort functions to apply on those lists. I first read the manual and thenstarted off with LinkedList.c to create all my functions, and then moved on to LinkedListTest.c to test all the functions before implementing sort. Sort was a bit confusing,but with the pseudocode provided, it make it so much easier to understand and impliment. If I had to do this lab again, I would refer back to the manual many more times throughout the coding process, because although I read it often when first starting, a lot of the bugs or confusion I had were slightly explained in the large paragrapsh in the manual.

In this lab I was able to complete all parts because of my change in time management. I started much earlier and was able to have time to read throuhg other online sources and go to labs which helped me understand the concepts more. I worked on this lab everyday starting tuesday with the exception of thursdy and friday because I was very sick. But thankfully since I had started early I did not leave the bulk for the last few days, and was able to quickly finsih up the lab once I felt better.
